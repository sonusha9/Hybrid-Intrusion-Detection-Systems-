# Hybrid-Intrusion-Detection-Systems-
Hybrid Intrusion Detection System which utilize combine method of signature based, anomaly based, host and network-based IDS methodologies. 

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a network security tool that monitors network traffic and devices for known malicious activity, suspicious activity or security policy violations. 

Goals:
To combine several detection models to achieve better results. 
Intrusion detection faces a number of challenges; an intrusion detection system must reliably detect malicious activities in a network and must perform efficiently to cope with the large amount of network traffic.
